# select-to-eof

## Features:

### `select-to-eof.seed` selects the currently selected string to the end of the file

+ Selection is case-sensitive.
+ Behaves similarly to <kbd>ctrl+shift+l</kbd>, except that it does not select before the cursor.

### `select-to-eof.toNextSelection` scrolls between the current cursors.

**Enjoy!**
